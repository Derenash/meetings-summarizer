  "important_decisions": "The team decided to focus on the Proof of Work as the primary consensus mechanism, after considering several alternatives including Proof of Stake and Proof of Location. Further discussions and explorations are needed on the concept of Runtime Normal Form and its potential applications.",
  "summary": "The discussion revolved around the concepts of various consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Location. The concept of 'Runtime Normal Form' and its use in measuring the complexity of transactions was also explored."
